# 11puzzleGamePythonProject
This file includes the code for project of solving a 11-puzzel game (a greater scale than 8-puzzle game)
This project use three different search algorithm, DFS, BFS and A*. 
For BFS and A*, algorithms are used base on two different heuristic that help the game to be solved in more efficient way.
Heuristic that are used, are admissible and inspired by hamming distance and manhatan distance heuristics. 
In this project the diagonal move also added to the possible moves of tiles, so the manhatan distance heuristuc here is changed to contain diagonal move
