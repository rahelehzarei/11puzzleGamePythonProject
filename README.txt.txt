IT CAN BE EXECUTED IN COMMAND PROMPT BY FOLLOWING COMMAND:
[DIRECTORY OF PYTHON EXE].PYTHON.EXE [DIRECTORY OF PYTHON FILE]
EXAMPLE: C:\Users\rahel\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts>python.exe C:\Users\rahel\Desktop\miniproject1.py
NAME OF THE PROJECT FILE IS : MINIPROJECT1.PY
PROGRAM USE THREE LIBRARIES:
os.path
copy
heapq
IT ASKS FOR THE PUZZLE INITIAL STATE AND IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH 11 INTEGER NUMBERS.
INPUT INTEGER SHOULD BE ENTERED WITH ONE SPACE BETWEEN EACH NUMBER AND NO SPACE BEFORE THE FIRST CHARACTER AND AFTER THE LAST CHARACTER.
FIVE TEXT FILE WILL BE CREATED IN ROOT OF PYTHON DIRECTORY.
FIVE TEXT FILE CONTAINS THE RESULT OF EACH ALGORITH.
A FILE WITH THE NAME OF puzzleDfs.tx WILL CREATE FOR DFS ALOGORITHM.
LIMIT FOR DFS SEARCH IS SET TO 10.
A FILE WITH THE NAME OF puzzleBfs_h1.tx WILL CREATE FOR BFS ALGORITHM WITH HEURISTIC H1.
A FILE WITH THE NAME OF puzzleBfs_h2.tx WILL CREATE FOR BFS ALGORITHM WITH HEURISTIC H2.
A FILE WITH THE NAME OF puzzleAs_h1.tx WILL CREATE FOR A* ALGORITHM WITH HEURISTIC H1.
A FILE WITH THE NAME OF puzzleAs_h2.tx WILL CREATE FOR A* ALGORITHM WITH HEURISTIC H2.
IF ALGORITHMS DO NOT FIND ANY SOLUTION FOR THE PUZZLE IN TEXT FILE WILL BE "NO SOLUTION FOUND".
PROGRAM START SOLVING PUZZLE AND CREATE FIEL RESULTS ONE BY ONE FROM DFS TO A* ALGORITHMS.
PROGRAM TERMINATE AFTER PASSING ALL FIVE ALOGIRTHMS AND GENERATING TEXT FILES.
